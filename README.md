# ➡️ Competencies Acquired

- **Algorithm Design**: Gained experience in designing and implementing efficient sorting algorithms tailored for specific constraints.

- **Data Structures**: Worked with stacks as the primary data structure, understanding their behavior and manipulation.

- **Optimization**: Learned to optimize operations to achieve minimal steps, focusing on time and space complexity.

- **Problem-Solving**: Enhanced analytical thinking by devising strategies to sort stacks within given constraints.

- **Debugging and Testing**: Strengthened debugging skills by testing edge cases, ensuring the program's reliability under all scenarios.

# ➡️ Program Features

1. **Sorting Algorithms**:  
   - Implemented sorting logic to arrange integers in ascending order.  
   - Used algorithms such as:  
     - **Small Stack Sorting**: Optimized methods for stacks with 3 to 5 elements.  
     - **Radix Sort**: Efficient sorting for larger stacks using binary representation.  

2. **Operations**:  
   - Developed a set of stack operations, including:  
     - `sa`, `sb`, `ss`: Swap the first two elements of a stack.  
     - `pa`, `pb`: Push the top element from one stack to another.  
     - `ra`, `rb`, `rr`: Rotate a stack (shift all elements up).  
     - `rra`, `rrb`, `rrr`: Reverse rotate a stack (shift all elements down).  

3. **Efficiency Goals**:  
   - Minimized the number of operations to achieve the sorting.  
   - Evaluated performance based on the total operation count for different
